# Dotfiles

Hello nerds!

The following repository contains the majority of my dotfiles that I use across Gentoo and Arch Linux.

## Why?

My initial but resolute extant Arch Linux install was a lesson in misery. I struggled every step along the way until I ended up with a patchwork monstrosity of Googled answers and forum copypastas. I refuse to touch certain config files because they work.

Recently, I decided I wish to _actually_ learn Linux. Linux, via the myriad distributions available, is immenently usable despite some kinks. However, I want to actually understand how the software fits together and _what_ is doing _bleh._ I chose Gentoo for kicks, but I enjoy it despite the lengthy compilation times.

I am not an ideologue. I love Linux, Windows, and FreeBSD. I do have a preference for F.O.S.S., but I'd be a liar if I said I **only** use open source. Last I checked, neither my P.C. nor PlayStation or Nintendo games are open source. With that said, I am thoroughly enjoying Linux, and I feel that my configs are at the point that I'd want to back some of them up while having them publicly available for those partaking in the same journey.

## Who should use these?

Are you a thinking, rational individual? Please ctrl+w if you answered "yes."

I hope that some of these configurations may aid someone somewhere, but honestly only a fool would use any of these wholesale. I am proud of managing to scrape together a working Unbound with DNSSEC that updates root.hints and whatnot on my system's boot. On the other hand, I surely have the worst use flags in all of existence.
